<h1>Welcome to My Repository</h1>

<p>This repository contains a collection of projects that I've worked on over the years.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My Name is Ben, a recent UC Berkeley graduate based in California. I have a strong passion for Data Science and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In my free time, I write scripts using the Google Maps API for Geoguessr.
I use my knowledge in GIS and Data Science to create maps and to learn about the geography of countries. This has helped me become globally ranked in Geoguessr -- top 300. It's a really great hobby I intend to pursue more.</p>

<h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
<p>Within this repository, you'll see various projects I completed during my attendance at the University of California, Berkeley. It covers a wide collection of my projects; you'll see projects in Java and Python.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started, simply browse through the folders and explore the projects. README's will be provided to outline and describe each project.</p>

<h2>Contributions</h2>
<p>Not all of these projects were completely without aid. As you will see, certain files within projects were create by Cal faculty. This was done in order to provide GUI, hidden tests for grading, and more.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my projects repository ðŸ˜Š</p>
